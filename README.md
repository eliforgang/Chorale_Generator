# Chorale_Generator
A small neural network trained on harmonic progressions from 70 major Bach chorales along with a code to build a harmonic progression based on sheet music.

Much of the neural network code is heavily based on Andrej Karpathy's code from his video Let's build GPT video which I have linked here.
